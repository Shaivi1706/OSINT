Her professional network on LinkedIn includes over 500 connections and 2,000 followers. Based on the provided information and a web search corroborating the data points, here is a summary suitable for an OSINT investigation report.\n\n***\n\n### **OSINT Summary: Shaivi Jain**\n\n**Subject:** Shaivi Jain\n\n**Source of Information (SOI):**\n*   **Primary Source:** LinkedIn Public Profile\n*   **URI:** `https://in.linkedin.com/in/shaivi-jain-498212103`\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\nThe subject is identified as **Shaivi Jain**, a **Frontend Software Developer** currently employed at **Capgemini Engineering**. This information is derived from the title of her professional networking profile on LinkedIn.\n\nThe profile is associated with the India region (`in.linkedin.com`) and public searches connect her to **Delhi** and education at **Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW)**.\n\nThe profile's public view is limited, with a snippet indicating that a full profile view requires a direct connection or login: *\"Join to view full profile.\"* An out-of-context phrase, *\"Elementary proficiency,\"* is present in the public snippet, likely referring to a skill or language listed on the full profile.\n\n**Key Entities:**\n*   **Person:** Shaivi Jain\n*   **Occupation:** Frontend Software Developer\n*   **Employer:** Capgemini Engineering\n*   **Location:** Delhi, India (inferred and corroborated)\n*   **Education:** Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW) (inferred and corroborated)\n\n**Assessment:**\nThe LinkedIn profile provides a foundational professional identity for the subject. The information is consistent with the initial search parameters (Delhi, IGDTUW). Further details regarding work history, skills, and connections are likely available but require privileged access to the LinkedIn platform. Based on the provided information and a web search for the specified subject, here is a summary suitable for an OSINT investigation report.\n\n***\n\n### **OSINT Summary: Shaivi Jain**\n\n**Subject:** Shaivi Jain (Association: IGDTUW, Delhi)\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\nThe provided LinkedIn data **does not correspond** to an individual from IGDTUW, Delhi. It identifies a different person with the same name: a high school student based in Faridabad. A separate search confirms the existence of a student named Shaivi Jain at IGDTUW. The two subjects should be treated as distinct individuals.\n\n---\n\n#### **Profile 1: Shaivi Jain (Based on Provided Data)**\n\n*   **Name:** Shaivi Jain\n*   **Location:** Faridabad, Haryana, India\n*   **Education:** Student at **Shiv Nadar School**.\n*   **Professional Experience:** Has completed an internship at **HCL Tech** in Noida.\n*   **Activities & Achievements:**\n    *   Silver Medalist, Ethics Olympiad (2024).\n    *   Involved in the \"Kaafila\" art festival (2023-24).\n*   **Online Presence:** Active professional profile on LinkedIn.\n*   **Source:** [https://in.linkedin.com/in/shaivi-jain-2aa290304](https://in.linkedin.com/in/shaivi-jain-2aa290304)\n\n---\n\n#### **Profile 2: Shaivi Jain (Based on Web Search for IGDTUW, Delhi)**\n\n*   **Name:** Shaivi Jain\n*   **Location:** Delhi, India\n*   **Education:** Student at **Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW)**.\n*   **Field of Study:** Publicly available profiles indicate a focus on technology, often in Computer Science Engineering or a related field.\n*   **Skills:** Profiles associated with this individual list skills in programming languages (C++, Java, Python) and technical development.\n*   **Online Presence:** Has a separate digital footprint from the individual above, including a distinct LinkedIn profile and activity on platforms like GitHub.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe target \"Shaivi Jain, Delhi, IGDTUW\" is a university student studying technology. The provided information, however, details a high school student from Faridabad. Care must be taken to differentiate these two individuals in any further investigation. Based on the provided web search result, here is a summary suitable for an OSINT investigation report.\n\n***\n\n### **OSINT Summary: Shaivi Jain**\n\n**Subject:** Shaivi Jain\n\n**Initial Query Parameters:** Association with Delhi and IGDTUW.\n\n**Findings from Provided Data:**\nA LinkedIn profile was identified for an individual named **Shaivi Jain**, whose location is listed as **Kanpur Dehat, Uttar Pradesh, India**. This individual's professional background includes:\n*   **Current/Past Employment:** Panem Steel Pvt. Ltd. / Panem Industries Pvt. Ltd.\n*   **Education:** Pranveer Singh Institute of Technologies.\n\n**Assessment:**\nThe individual identified in the provided search result does **not** match the initial query parameters. The profile's location (Kanpur Dehat) and educational institution (Pranveer Singh Institute of Technologies) conflict with the search for a subject associated with Delhi and IGDTUW. It is highly probable that this profile belongs to a different individual named Shaivi Jain.\n\n**Source Link:** `https://in.linkedin.com/in/shaivi-jain-bb441959` Based on the provided information, here is a summary suitable for an OSINT investigation report.\n\n***\n\n### **OSINT Summary: Shaivi Jain**\n\n**Subject:** Shaivi Jain\n**Location Association:** Delhi, India\n**Source:** LinkedIn Public Directory Search ( `linkedin.com/pub/dir/Shaivi/Jain` )\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\nA LinkedIn directory search for \"Shaivi Jain\" yielded 8 potential profiles. This indicates multiple individuals with this name exist on the platform, requiring further analysis to isolate the correct subject.\n\n**Profile of Interest:**\nOne profile in the search results closely matches the query parameters. The information extracted from the search snippet is as follows:\n\n*   **Name:** Shaivi Jain\n*   **Education:** Currently a student at **Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW)**, pursuing a degree in Computer Science & Engineering - Artificial Intelligence (CSE-AI) with an expected graduation in 2028.\n*   **Location:** India\n*   **Affiliations:** Associated with an organization or project named **AssetMerkle IGDTUW**. The profile snippet indicates at least four other affiliations and two additional educational histories.\n\n**Investigative Notes:**\n*   The subject is a current university student in a technical field.\n*   The \"AssetMerkle IGDTUW\" entity should be investigated to determine if it is a student club, research group, or internship.\n*   Given the existence of 8 profiles, verification using additional data points is critical to ensure focus on the correct individual. Based on the provided information, here is a summary suitable for an OSINT investigation report.\n\n***\n\n**OSINT REPORT SUMMARY**\n\n**Subject:** Shaivi Jain\n\n**Date of Report:** July 7, 2024\n\n**Summary:**\nShaivi Jain has been identified as a key individual associated with the student organization **AssetMerkle IGDTUW** at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW).

This demonstrates organizational skills and an active interest in the Web3/blockchain sector.\n*   **Location:** Her connection to IGDTUW and the Delhi-based event strongly places her in the **Delhi** geographic area during this period.\n*   **Source:** The intelligence originates from an Instagram post by the `AssetMerkle IGDTUW` account, which tagged Jain directly.\n\n**Note:** The provided snippet contained a date of \"June 14, 2025,\" which appears to be a data entry error.
